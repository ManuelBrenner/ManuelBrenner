# Dr. Manuel Brenner

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing** in Heidelberg, specializing in **dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR)**, particularly the development of **interpretable models for time series analysis** with real-world applications, including neuroscience, health, and AI safety.

My research interests also include the study of **creativity in AI**, with applications to **AI safety**.

## Research and Main Publications

Here are some of the repositories that highlight my contributions in **dynamical systems modeling**, **time series analysis**, and **AI**:

- **[dendPLRNN: Tractable Dendritic RNNs for Reconstructing Nonlinear Dynamical Systems](https://github.com/DurstewitzLab/dendPLRNN)** — This repository contains the code for our work on dendritic piecewise linear recurrent neural networks for nonlinear dynamical systems reconstruction.
  
- **[Almost-Linear RNNs Yield Highly Interpretable Symbolic Codes in Dynamical Systems Reconstruction](https://github.com/DurstewitzLab/ALRNN-DSR)** — Repository for our work on almost-linear RNNs (**NIPS 2024**) for time series analysis and dynamical system reconstruction with symbolic interpretation.
  
- **[Integrating Multimodal Data for Joint Generative Modeling of Complex Dynamics (ICML 2024)](https://github.com/DurstewitzLab/MTF)** — This repo contains code for the multimodal teacher forcing framework we proposed in our **ICML 2024** paper for reconstructing complex dynamical systems from multimodal and non-Gaussian measurements.

- **[Learning Hierarchical Dynamics Models from Time Series Data (ICLR 2025)](https://github.com/DurstewitzLab/HierarchicalDSR)** — Code for our hierarchical RNN-based approach for learning interpretable models from time series data across multiple subjects and systems, presented at **ICLR 2025**.
